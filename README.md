# It doesn't work, can you help?
At the moment this is a project I have started as a hobby and may not be able to provide support in the meantime.

# Will this cost me my life savings just to access it?
Absolutely not, in fact, I do not plan to charge for this app at all, just don't monetize this yourself if you ever build a fork.
I won't be adding any trackers or advertisements either, but keep in mind that the stations you listen to can still track some aspects of your usage, such as your IP address and how long you listen.

# How is this tested?
It is being tested on both my Samsung Galaxy S24 and a Android Emulator running similar firmware as a Google Pixel.

# Are Stations Included?
Due to licensing and copyright concerns, I may not be able to provide radio links, but my hope is to add either custom M3U support or a method of adding stations manually in the app.
Whilst the app is in development, there may be a couple of Radio Stations used for testing but in compiled apks they will be removed to avoid potential legal troubles.
I will however be looking into including stations down the road, this may include asking radio operators for permission but I would not be surprised if they want to either be paid or decline due to their wishes to lock you into their own respective apps.
