# What is Open Android Radio?
Open Android Radio is an experimental project intended as a internet radio client for mobile devices.

# It doesn't work, can you help?
at the moment this is a project I have started as a hobby and will not be able to provide support for.

# How is this tested?
It is being tested on both my Samsung Galaxy S24 and a Android Emulator running similar firmware as a Google Pixel.

# Are Stations Included?
Due to licensing and copyright concerns, I may not be able to provide radio links, but my hope is to add either custom M3U support or a method of adding stations manually in the app.
Whilst the app is in development, there may be a couple of Radio Stations used for testing but in compiled apks they will be removed to avoid potential legal troubles.
I will however be looking into including stations down the road, this may include asking radio operators for permission but I would not be surprised if they want to either be paid or decline due to their wishes to lock you into their own respective apps.
