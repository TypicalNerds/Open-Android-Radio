For More Info, view the ReadMe over on the [OAR-Presets Repo](https://github.com/TypicalNerds/OAR-Presets).

## I Can't get the image for a station to load.
As of writing, images stored on device are not supported, so for the image link you should enter in a direct link to the JPEG or PNG File.

## It doesn't work, can you help?
At the moment this is a project I have started as a hobby and may not be able to provide support in the meantime.

However, if you notice that the app wont play a station, check your connection or the URL you entered when you added the station, additionally, just try restarting the app by fully stopping it first.

## Play Store/Alt Store release when?
I am in the process of getting the app through the closed testing phase for the Google Play Store, as for other stores, I'd be happy for any other alt store such as F-Droid to re-distribute it as long as they don't make any major modifications or remove the links/credits to this GitHub, after all, it is open for everyone to use it.

## Will this cost me my life savings just to access it?
Absolutely not, in fact, I do not plan to charge for this app at all, just don't monetize this yourself if you ever build a fork.
I won't be adding any trackers or advertisements either, but keep in mind that the stations you listen to can still track some aspects of your usage, such as your IP address and how long you listen.

## How is this tested?
It is being tested on both my Samsung Galaxy S24 and a Android Emulator running similar firmware as a Google Pixel.
