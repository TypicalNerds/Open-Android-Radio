# I Can't get the image for a station to load.
As of writing, images stored on device are not supported, so for the image link you should enter in a direct link to the JPEG or PNG File.

If you are trying to find UK Radio Stations, I have a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TypicalNerds/LakesideTV-Channel-Logos/tree/main/Radio) available, all you'd have to do is use the RAW image urls for each station.

# It doesn't work, can you help?
At the moment this is a project I have started as a hobby and may not be able to provide support in the meantime.

However, if you notice that the app wont play a station, check your connection or the URL you entered when you added the station, additionally, just try restarting the app by fully stopping it first.

# Will this cost me my life savings just to access it?
Absolutely not, in fact, I do not plan to charge for this app at all, just don't monetize this yourself if you ever build a fork.
I won't be adding any trackers or advertisements either, but keep in mind that the stations you listen to can still track some aspects of your usage, such as your IP address and how long you listen.

# How is this tested?
It is being tested on both my Samsung Galaxy S24 and a Android Emulator running similar firmware as a Google Pixel.

# Are Stations Included?
As of Writing, a limited number of Major UK Radio Stations are available at a single press of a button, these can then be edited to match your local area or you can choose to stick with the national uk feeds.
